## OUTPUT PROTOCOL: THE LEARNING LOOP FORMAT

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:**
To enable future system learning, you must separate your "Variables" from your "Verdict."
Follow this strict output order for EVERY race.

### 1. 🛑 THE DATA SIGNATURE (Internal Audit)
*Before* giving the ticket, you must log the raw variables used for your decision.
**Format:** A strict code block labeled `### DATA_LOG`.
* **Speed_Gap:** [e.g., "+6pts (Dominant)"]
* **Eff_Weight_Rank:** [e.g., "Rank 2 (Light)"]
* **Pace_Profile:** [e.g., "Fast - Suits Closers"]
* **Jockey_Bonus:** [e.g., "Pike (Maiden) = Yes"]
* **Form_Cycle:** [e.g., "3rd up / Peaking"]
* **Track_History:** [e.g., "Won at Distance"]
